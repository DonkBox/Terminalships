# Terminalships
### It's my first Python project so the goal of it is to test what I've learned up to this point.

### •	What does my program do? 
   ######	It is a battleship videogame that works in the terminal. This videogame follows the rules of the Tactic® Battleship board game.

### •	Is it one player or two players?
  #####	It’s a single player game.

### •	Project objectives:
   #####	Build a terminal program using Python.
   #####	Add at least one interactive feature using input().
   #####	Use Git version control.
   #####	Use the command line and file navigation.
   #####	Write a technical blog post on the project.
